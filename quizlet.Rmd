    - Flashcards, Test, and Match are best for our course
        - Match evaluates your ability to recognize or identify the correct definition for each term.
        This is the easiest approach and a good starting place.
        - Test also evaluates your ability to recognize or identify the correct definition for term but uses a variety of testing strategies.
        This study method is more challenging than Match.
