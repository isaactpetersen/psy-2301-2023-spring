<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Learning and Succeeding in Introduction to
Clinical Psychology</h1>

</div>


<p>In this course, our goal is for you to learn about and understand the
science of clinical psychology, its application to the real world, and
the limitations and strengths of the clinically relevant research and
claims you encounter. We have created this document to describe
evidence-based strategies for learning and applying the course material,
as well as preparing for exams.</p>
<div id="attend-and-participate-in-every-class-session"
class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Attend and Participate
in Every Class Session</h1>
<ul>
<li><u>Attend every lecture and class discussion section.</u> Attendance
is important for learning the material. Get notes if you miss a
class.</li>
<li><ins>
Take good notes
</ins>
in every lecture and discussion section, and while doing the readings.
We purposefully leave blanks in our Powerpoint slides that necessitate
notetaking. Taking notes will facilitate active learning AND be useful
when preparing for exams. Don’t try to copy down verbatim what the
instructor or TA is saying. Rather, think about the new concepts they
are introducing and find ways to summarize the new information in ways
that will make sense to you later along the way. Review your notes
carefully, and let your TA or Prof know if you have any questions or
points of confusions!</li>
<li><ins>
Participate fully in active-learning opportunities in lectures and
discussion sections
</ins>
. We will try to provide opportunities in every class session to discuss
ideas with your neighbors, to write about your perspectives, and to
answer questions or solve problems on the Powerpoint slides.</li>
<li><ins>
Ask questions
</ins>
in class (we’ll address as many as we can!). And ask questions outside
of class. You can do this right after class or discussion section. You
can come to office hours with any of the TAs or with Dr. Petersen. You
can email questions to any of the TAs or Dr. Petersen. You can also ask
other students in the class or in your study group about your questions.
We know that it can be anxiety-provoking to talk with your TAs or course
instructors, but we all love talking with students, and we’re really
good at figuring out what is confusing you and then helping you to
understand it better!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="do-all-of-the-required-readings-and-assignments"
class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Do All of the Required
Readings and Assignments</h1>
<p>Completion of the required readings and assignments is an important
prerequisite for learning the material.</p>
</div>
<div id="pay-particular-attention-to-what-is-most-important"
class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Pay Particular
Attention to What is Most Important</h1>
<p>There is too much content in the class to remember everything, so it
is important to prioritize studying the most important information.</p>
<ins>
Pay close attention to things that are emphasized, including things that
are talked about more than once.
</ins>
<p>Certain concepts will be emphasized much more than others. If we
discuss something several times or with greater emphasis, it is because
it is a critical concept and we want to make sure you understand it.
Listen for themes that come up in both lecture and discussions sections.
Make sure you understand what is important about them!</p>
<ins>
Pay particular to the take-away messages of each lecture, discussion
section, and reading.
</ins>
<p>When you read an article or review a lecture, ask yourself: “What are
the main messages Dr. Petersen wants us to hear?” After attending
lecture and the discussion sections, close your notes and ask yourself,
“What were the main points that Dr. Petersen or the TA emphasized and
what was important about them?” Similarly, after reading the assignment
for discussion sections or lecture, turn the material face down and ask
yourself, “What was important about this reading? What about this is
relevant to lecture and section? What are the main things to learn?” If
you read a research article, ask yourself “What are the main findings?
What are the strengths and limitations of the study?”</p>
<ins>
Pay attention to the examples Dr. Petersen and the TAs use in lecture
and section.
</ins>
<p>Examples will help place the different concepts into context. Think
about the different examples given in class and use them to learn how
each concept can be applied. This should give you a better understanding
of what might otherwise be an abstract concept.</p>
<p><u>Focus on understanding the concepts</u>, not just memorizing the
details. Students are often taught to memorize facts to be successful in
class. Although memorizing some facts will be helpful in this class, we
really want you to understand how the facts are <em>applied</em> in
clinical psychology. Thus, many test questions will require that you
both know the facts and understand more abstract concepts. To succeed in
this class, it is important that you think deeply about and learn to
apply the knowledge from lecture and section, rather than simply
memorizing it. You will do best on exams if you go beyond memorizing and
critically think about the ideas we present in lecture and discussion
sections. In addition to understanding the concepts, you should
understand why the concepts are important and how to apply them. Compare
concepts discussed in class and think about how they are similar or
different. Apply concepts to real world scenarios and think through the
examples presented in class. Put the concepts into your own words and
try to teach them to someone else. This helps you figure out what you do
and don’t understand, which puts you in a better position to ask
specific questions after class or in office hours.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Use Effective Study
Strategies</h1>
<div id="schedule-study-time" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Schedule Study
Time</h2>
<ins>
Do not leave things for last minute.
</ins>
<p>You will have a lot to study before you know it. Try to keep up with
the material and ask questions if you have them.</p>
<p><u>Study for shorter but more frequent periods.</u> One of the
<strong>BEST</strong> things you can do to learn the course material is
<ins><strong>study for a shorter amount of time, on multiple days a
week, and for every week of the semester</strong></ins>. Research
clearly indicates that this is a much more effective approach than
cramming your studying into two or three longer study sessions right
before the exam. In a nutshell, the research on studying tells us that
humans best remember information when they practice recalling that
information across numerous study sessions.</p>
<p>For instance, if you budget one hour to learn all the different types
of reliability and validity, you will be more likely to remember them on
test day if you study them for 15 minutes across four days rather than
studying them for a single hour at one time. Thus, even though you’re
not studying the information for any longer, spreading out the times
that you study (i.e., revisiting the material again and again for
briefer study sessions) is the best approach to successfully remembering
the information on test day and beyond the course itself.</p>
<p>We recommend studying the course material for 4–5 hours per week
across three 90-minute study sessions or across four-to-five 60-minute
study sessions. We suggest scheduling these study sessions in your
calendar to occur every week just like you would your classes. Here is
an example of what your study session schedule might look like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Monday</th>
<th align="left">Tuesday</th>
<th align="left">Wednesday</th>
<th align="left">Thursday</th>
<th align="left">Friday</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">8:00–9:30</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">11:30–1:00</td>
<td align="left">5:30–7:00</td>
<td align="left"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that you have scheduled regular study sessions, what is the most
effective way to design your study strategy within each session?
Research indicates that <ins>the most effective study strategy spreads
out testing yourself on different parts of the material
<strong>within</strong> study sessions as well as
<strong>between</strong> study sessions</ins>. For instance, if you want
to remember the inclusion and exclusion criteria for mental disorders,
you might test yourself on what you remember, check your answers, and
then move on to study something else. Then, at the end of the same study
session, you could test yourself again on inclusion and exclusion
criteria and check your answers. You could also decide to test yourself
on these criteria at the start of each study session for a week, until
remembering the information becomes easy and you can recall it
automatically. This helps your brain practice successful remembering. If
something is difficult to remember, try struggling with it before you
show yourself the answer. Memory works sort of like a muscle, so
challenging your brain to remember something difficult can help you
remember more successfully the next time.</p>
<p>Below, <ins>we’ve included an example week of how individual study
sessions might be structured using the spaced-out approach</ins> during
a week early in the semester, when you have had the first three lectures
and have already spent some time studying the first two lectures. Keep
in mind that the third lecture has more material than the first two
lectures and is the most recently learned (so the least studied). Thus,
it is allotted the most time. Imagine spending 15–20 minutes on each
block within a session. Customize these study sessions to spend the most
time on course material that feels the most challenging to you and less
time on material that you feel more confident about. <ins>As you can
see, the lectures repeat across days and within single study sessions,
and the study approaches draw from a variety of the effective study
techniques we described in more detail in discussion section (and
below!)</ins>.</p>
</div>
<div id="test-yourself" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Test Yourself</h2>
<p>One of the <strong>BEST</strong> ways to learn the course material
and do well on the exams is to <ins><strong>test yourself</strong></ins>
on key concepts, their distinctions, and their
implications/applications, rather than just re-reading or re-writing
your notes over and over again. Ask yourself questions about the
material you have studied, answer them, and THEN check to see if you are
correct. For example, after reviewing the first lecture, you might close
your materials, then ask yourself “What are the four main measurement
strategies in scientific clinical psychology, and how are they defined?”
or “What are some key characteristics of scientific clinical
psychology?” or “What are some key challenges facing scientific clinical
psychology?”</p>
<ins>
Take advantage of the study questions for each exam.
</ins>
<p>The study questions posted on ICON are a great tool that will help
you check for understanding of concepts.</p>
</div>
<div id="put-material-into-your-own-words" class="section level2"
number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Put Material Into
Your Own Words</h2>
<p>Another one of the <strong>BEST</strong> ways to learn the course
material and do well on the exams is to <ins><strong>put the course
material into your own words</strong></ins> or <ins><strong>try to
explain the material to someone/something else (including your ceiling
fan)</strong><ins>.</p>
<p>Close your notes on a particular portion of the material and then ask
yourself some of the following questions or explain them to
someone/something else: “What are the main points, concepts, and
findings, in my own words? What is important about key points, concepts
and findings, in my own words? What might another example of a key
concept be? How can key concepts be applied? How do key concepts differ
from one another, in my own words?”</p>
<p>Similarly, after reading a research article for discussion section,
turn the material face down and ask yourself some of the following
questions: “What is important about this reading, in my own words? What
about this paper is relevant to our course? What are the main findings?
What are the strengths and limitations of the study??</p>
<p>These approaches—which move beyond memorizing concepts—will help you
more deeply understand and learn to apply course material, which is
critical to success in this course. These approaches also help you
figure out what’s confusing you, so you’re in a better position to ask
questions during/after class, over email, or in office hours.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Go Easy on Less
Effective Study Strategies</h1>
<p>Finally, we’re going to touch briefly on <ins><strong>what doesn’t
work well</strong></ins> when trying to learn course material and
prepare for exams. Research tells us that re-reading or re-writing notes
over and over again doesn’t improve your understanding of course
material and test performance, even though it may feel like the material
is becoming easier or more familiar. As we noted above, cramming most of
your studying into the day or two before the exam also results in less
understanding and poorer test scores. Active learning and testing
methods are key to improving understanding and doing better on exams,
even if they feel more challenging. Thus, we urge you to complete the
Study Questions, ask yourself questions, and try to put course material
into your own words!</p>

<div id="ask-us-questions-and-let-us-know-when-youre-confused"
class="section level1" number="6">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Ask Us Questions and
Let Us Know When You’re Confused</h1>
<p>Every one of us—including your TAs and Profs!—have questions and get
confused about course material sometimes. When this happens to you (and
it will!), remember that you have a lot of options: you can ask
questions inside or outside of class, you can come to office hours with
us, and you can email us. We know that talking with us can be
challenging, but we encourage you to get outside your comfort zone and
give it a try! 😊 We all love working with students, and we all want you
to succeed in our class. Ask for help when you need it!</p>

<div id="use-effective-test-taking-strategies" class="section level1"
number="7">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Use Effective
Test-Taking Strategies</h1>
<ul>
<li>Arrive early and relax in the minutes before the exam. You might
focus on your breathing, close your eyes and focus on vividly recalling
a relaxing scene or experience, or slowly clench and release some muscle
groups in your body.</li>
<li>Make an initial rapid pass through the exam in which you answer
every question you can. Don’t spend too long on any single question—just
flag the ones about which you are uncertain and move on. But do read the
instructions, the questions, and the responses carefully, so you don’t
make careless errors.</li>
<li>On your second pass through the exam, take a little longer (but not
too long!) on each of the remaining questions and make your best call on
each one.</li>
<li>Leave time to review your answers if you can.</li>
<li>Keep a good eye on your time, and manage your time well, so that you
have sufficient time to make both the first and second pass through the
exam.</li>
<li>Ask questions if you have them. We’ll let you know if we can’t
answer them.</li>
<li>Get a good night’s sleep before the exam! This will improve your
long-term memory for course material and make it easier to access during
the exam.</li>
<li>Get some exercise or engage in physical activity of some sort (even
a brief walk!). Physical activity can improve your ability to focus on
challenging tasks and reduce your anxiety about the exam.</li>
<li>Evaluate your performance and the adequacy of your preparation after
the exam (both before and after you know how you did!). What worked
well, and what should you consider doing differently when preparing for
and taking the next exam? Feel free to come discuss this with the TAs or
Dr. Petersen!</li>
