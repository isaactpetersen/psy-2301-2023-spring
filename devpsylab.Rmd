## Our Mission

We are striving to improve the health and well-being of families and communities by conducting research to advance the understanding of human development.

## Current Study

To accomplish our mission, we are are currently conducting the School Readiness Study.
The School Readiness Study is a longitudinal study that follows children from 3–7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective.
In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes.
